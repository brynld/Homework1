## Overview and Origin

* Ethos

* Ethos was founded in 2016 by Peter Colis and Lingke Wang. The founders realized that huge amounts of Americans are underinsured or unimformed about life insurance policies after one of the founders was oversold an unnecessary and expensive life insurance policy without fully understanding the cost and process. To date Ethos has raised $106.5 million of capital through three rounds of funding in Series A, B, and C investing led by venture capital firms consisting of Accel, Sequoia Capital, and Goldman Sachs, as well as funding from Stanford University, Downey Ventures, Arrive, and Smith Family Circle.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

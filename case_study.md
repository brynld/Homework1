# Fintech Case Study

### Overview and Origin

## Ethos

* Ethos was founded in 2016 by Peter Colis and Lingke Wang. The founders realized that huge amounts of Americans are underinsured or unimformed about life insurance policies after one of the founders was oversold an unnecessary and expensive life insurance policy without fully understanding the cost and process. To date Ethos has raised $106.5 million of capital through three rounds of funding in Series A, B, and C investing led by venture capital firms consisting of Accel, Sequoia Capital, and Goldman Sachs, as well as funding from Stanford University, Downey Ventures, Arrive, and Smith Family Circle. 


## Business Activities:

Ethos is tackling the issue of life insurance. The typical life insurance application can take weeks to get approved and will usually require a medical exam. Additionally, a large amount of customers do not have the proper coverage they need for their specific situations. Ethos has streamlined the application process, taking it completely online and incorporating verification of self-reported data through medical and pharmacy records to allow approval in minutes, as well as experts available to assist in finding the right policy with a money-back guarantee. 

The intended customer of Ethos is any adult seeking life insurance. Currently the life insurance and annuities industry is valued at $723.3 billion. 
Ethos offers a fully online application that takes on average about 10 minutes with almost instant approval or rejection. Their process typically does not require a medical exam like the majority of their competitors, and is an exponentially faster approval processes than their more traditional competitors. 

Ethos is taking advantage of both automation to eliminate repetitive and time consuming paperwork as well as predictive analytics technology for underwriting their policies. 


## Landscape:

Ethos operates in the Insurtech domain.

The life insurance industry has not had much innovation in the last 5-10 years. It has been mostly overlooked until now compared to industries like banking and investing due to the agent-based nature of the industry. Even now most processes in the industry are manual. 

Ethos has two subsets of competitors. The first being the more traditional life insurance brokers such as Aflac, Guardian Life, and Kansas City Life Insurance Company. The second being other insurtech startups such as Policygenius and Bestow.

## Results

So far, Ethos has caused the life insurance industry to reevaluate the classic approach to their processes, and how to speed along the application process to save both time and money. It has also left consumers with access to information that allows themto be more informed when it comes to what sort of coverage they need and what it should cost.

The insurance industry measures success based on revenue per policyholder, average cost per claim, average time to settle a claim, return on surplus, loss ratio, frequency, severity, and renewal/retention. Because it is still a startup, there is not much data available on how Ethos is performing by these standards, but their estimated revenue ($17.4 million) outperforms almost all of their insurtech competitors. 



## Recommendations

I would advise that Ethos expand their backing with other life insurance companies (they are currently only the broker for policies through two larger companies) to increase the amount of term life insurance policies offered, as well as to add the ability to compare their quote with that of competitors through their app or website. 

By offering a wider range of policies they would increase their potential customer base, allowing them to increase revenues as they grow. The feature allowing users to compare their quote to that of major competitors reaffirms their policy of simplicity to the customer, and also helps show more clearly that Ethos is the better option for the price, and that if it is not the best price option, they are sticking to their stated value of helping customers get the best value for their money, even if it is with a competitor. 

Adding further coverage options would not require much more technology besides adding the options to the platform. Adding a quote comparison feature would require building out code and algorithms creating the functionality within the app or website that understands the quote process and requirements of competitors, and on the back end while computing the Ethos quote based on the customer's input information, also calculating what the quote would be for that customer based on their information from competitors. 

I believe that this technology would be best for this situation because it would be the best way to give the customer value from their site. If they required the customer to input the quote comparison on their own, they are losing the value they give the customer by performing that work for them.
